<h2 align="center">✨ Features</h2>

<h3 align="center">🚚 Browse Every Mod You Own - <i>Even the Awkward Ones</i></h3>

Easy SCSModManager reads your local `mod/` folder and your Steam Workshop subscriptions for both ETS2 and ATS, and shows them in a card grid that looks like the in-game manager - just better.

- **Every container format** - plain `.scs`, ZIP-based `.scs`, HashFS v1 and v2 (decoded with a pure-Python reader, no external tools), and unpacked mod folders
- **Reads the mods the in-game browser shows** - name, icon and description straight from each mod's `manifest.sii`, so a workshop mod called `universal.scs` still shows its real name
- **Workshop previews** - when a mod has no readable local icon, the Steam Workshop preview image fills in
- **Search, sort and filter** - full-text search across name, author and category, sort by name or install date, filter by category, workshop-only or favourites-only
- **Multi-select** with Ctrl / Shift (or Ctrl+A for everything visible) to activate, deactivate or delete whole batches at once
- **Delete mods to the trash** - right-click (or press Del) to remove local mods, with a warning if a saved profile still uses them; Workshop mods stay managed by Steam
- **Filter by source** - show all mods, only Workshop, or only your local ones
- **Responsive grid** - maximise the window and the grid adds columns to fill the width instead of leaving an empty strip; the cards keep their size
- **BVB-yellow accent** - the refined dark theme paints mod names in Borussia Dortmund yellow

<h3 align="center">🖱️ Drag and Drop Load Order - <i>The Whole Reason This Exists</i></h3>

The in-game mod manager only lets you nudge a mod up or down one row at a time. With 300 mods, getting one into the middle of the list means clicking *Move up* 150 times. Easy SCSModManager replaces that with a real drag and drop: scroll to the spot, drop the mod in, done.

- **Drag between panels** - pull mods from the library into the active list and back
- **Reorder by dragging** - rearrange the active load order directly, with smooth auto-scroll and a clear drop indicator
- **Grouped by load-order section** - the active list is split into load-order groups (financial, sound, trucks, trailers, maps, and so on) with clear headers, so a mod lands near the others of its kind
- **Out-of-place markers** - a mod that sits in the wrong group is flagged, with a right-click *Move to* to pin it where it belongs
- **Move whole selections to a group** - the *Move to* menu acts on every selected mod at once, plus an *Automatic* entry to send them back to their natural group; dragging a mod into a section keeps it there too
- **Writes straight to `profile.sii`** - your order is saved into the profile in plain text (the format the game reads without a signature check), so ETS2/ATS starts with exactly the order you set

</p>

<h3 align="center">🗺️ Map Combos - <i>Share a Setup, Not a Screenshot</i></h3>

Map combo authors usually pass their load order around as a screenshot or a typed list that everyone then re-clicks by hand. Easy SCSModManager turns that into a file. **Right-click the Maps group header** in the active list to export or import a combo.

- **Export** the map block of your load order to a small JSON file and share it
- **Import** a combo and the app rescans first, then sets your maps into the exact order the author used - your trucks, sounds and everything else stay untouched
- **Missing-map check** - if the combo needs a map you don't have, a dialog lists exactly which ones, by name, so you know what to grab before you play
- **Update hint** - if you have a map but the combo was built with a newer version (you have RusMap 2.2, the combo used 2.4), it tells you - as a hint, never a block

</p>

<h3 align="center">⚠️ Compatibility and Conflicts - <i>Spot Trouble Before the Game Crashes</i></h3>

- **Compatibility check** - mods are checked against the detected game version exactly the way the game does it: only a mod whose `manifest.sii` actually declares an incompatible version is flagged. A mod with no version info is never wrongly marked, so the 1.58 mod you run on purpose on 1.59 is left alone
- **Conflict severity at a glance** - when two active mods overwrite the same `def/` file, the higher one wins. Each affected mod is graded: a **yellow ⚠ triangle** when it loses *some* of its files (partly overwritten), a **red ⊘ crossed circle** when it loses *all* of them (fully overwritten - it does nothing where it sits), and no mark when it wins everything. The two shapes stay distinct in greyscale, so it reads without relying on colour
- **Full conflict tooltip + legend** - hover a flagged mod for every overwritten file and which mod wins it; a one-line legend appears under the active list while a conflict exists. It's a hint, not a block - for maps an overlap is often intentional
- **Generic-override filtering** - files that nearly every map touches are filtered out so the real conflicts don't drown in noise

<h3 align="center">🎮 Both Games, One Window - <i>ETS2 and ATS Side by Side</i></h3>

- **Game switcher** - flip between Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator from a single window; only installed games are selectable, and your choice is remembered for next launch
- **Auto-detection** - finds your install and profiles automatically on Linux (native and Proton) and Windows, or set the paths yourself in Settings
- **Favourites** - star the mods you reuse and filter to favourites only
- **Profile manager** - switch between your profiles and see which mods each one uses
- **Backup and restore** - every save can take a backup first, and any earlier profile is one click away from being restored

<h2 align="center">🌍 Translations</h2>

Easy SCSModManager ships with **English** and **German**. Want it in your language?

**Contributing a translation needs no coding.**

1. Copy the folder `easy_scsmodmanager/resources/i18n/en/` to `easy_scsmodmanager/resources/i18n/<your-code>/` (e.g. `ru/`)
2. Translate the values - never change the keys
3. Keep placeholders like `{count}` and `{name}` untouched
4. Check `easy_scsmodmanager/resources/i18n/languages.json`: if your language code has no entry yet, add one line with its code and its name in the language itself
5. Submit a Pull Request

A missing key shows up as the raw key in the interface, so gaps are easy to spot while you work.

<details>
<summary>🧪 Test your translation before the PR (optional, no coding either)</summary>

The app picks up any language folder automatically - you only need to run it from source once:

```bash
# Get the source: green "Code" button on GitHub -> Download ZIP -> unpack
# (or: git clone https://github.com/Switch-Bros/easy-scsmodmanager.git)

# In the unpacked folder:
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .

# Put your translation at easy_scsmodmanager/resources/i18n/<your-code>/main.json, then:
python -m easy_scsmodmanager
```

Your language appears under **Settings -> Language**; pick it and restart the app. Any text that still shows as a raw key like `menu.file.refresh` is a key you have not translated yet.

Requires **Python 3.13+** (from [python.org](https://www.python.org/), on Windows tick "Add python.exe to PATH" in the installer).

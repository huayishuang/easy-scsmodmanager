"""Runs the Steam Workshop fetcher for mods we lack local data for.

Pulled out of MainWindow. Owns the fetch thread's lifecycle: it picks the
workshop mods still missing an icon, a parsed manifest, or a real name, starts
the thread, and refreshes the UI as previews arrive. The window forwards its
close event so the thread can be waited on during shutdown.

# Changelog

## [1.3.2] - 2026-06-06

- **Activating a mod now sorts it into its own group.** Double-clicking a mod
  in the grid dropped it at the very top of the active list, so a mod from an
  earlier group could end up rendered under a later group's header. It now
  lands at the bottom of its own group's block, and the newly activated row is
  selected so you can see where it went. Thanks to LLBBC for the reproduction.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-06

- **Delete local mods from the app.** Right-click a mod (or select several) and
  choose "Delete..." to move it to the system trash - restore it from there if
  you change your mind. Workshop mods stay managed by Steam (the entry is shown
  but disabled). If a mod is still used by a saved load order, the confirmation
  names the affected profiles first. Thanks to 00player00 for the request.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-06

- **Self-contained dark theme.** The app now ships its own dark palette and
  stylesheet instead of relying on the OS theme. This fixes a hard-to-read
  interface (barely visible menu bar, invisible checkbox labels, a white
  map-base list) reported on Windows 11 with "system dark / apps light".
  The look no longer depends on your OS light/dark setting. Scrollbars are
  now styled consistently everywhere too.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-05

- **Auto-update.** The app can now check GitHub for a newer release. The
  AppImage and the Windows build can download a verified update (checked
  against the release SHA256SUMS) and restart into it; deb/rpm/AUR/tar.gz get
  a notice with the release notes and a link, and keep updating through their
  package manager. Toggle the startup check under Settings - Behaviour, or run
  it any time from Help - Check for Updates.
- **Windows: find Steam and the Documents folder via the registry.** Steam
  installed outside Program Files, and a moved (redirected) Documents folder,
  are now detected, so Workshop mods and profiles show up where earlier builds
  missed them.
- Save and restore dialogs now name the game you are actually using (ATS no
  longer warns about ETS2).
- **Jump from the grid to the active list.** Right-click a mod and choose
  "Show in active list", or enable click-to-jump under Settings - Behaviour
  (off by default).
- Live scan progress in the status bar, and a faster grid rebuild for very
  large libraries.
- More diagnostic logging around install detection, to make "game found but
  no Workshop" reports easier to pin down.
- New CONTRIBUTING and CODE_OF_CONDUCT, a committed `uv.lock` for reproducible
  contributor setups, and groundwork for community translations.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-06-04

- Detect Steam Workshop mods for native installs (Windows, macOS and native
  Linux), not just Proton - fixes Workshop mods staying invisible in the
  Windows build even when the game itself was found.
- A manual documents-folder override no longer switches the Workshop off: the
  Workshop is auto-detected unless you pin it yourself, and the Settings dialog
  now has its own Workshop-folder override per game.
- The language list is now driven entirely by which translations ship, so a new
  translation only needs to add its folder - groundwork for an upcoming Russian
  translation.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-06-04

- Write a rotating log file under a per-platform location (Windows
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%`, Linux `$XDG_STATE_HOME`), so problems are diagnosable even
  in the windowed Windows build where there is no console.
- Catch uncaught exceptions into the log instead of crashing silently.
- Log each mod's path before scanning it, so a scan that hangs leaves the
  culprit as the last line in the log.
- New **Tools - Open Log Folder** menu entry.
- New **.rpm** package for Fedora / openSUSE / RHEL.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-01

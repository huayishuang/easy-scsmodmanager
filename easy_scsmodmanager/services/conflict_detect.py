"""Detect mods that overwrite the same def file.

Two active mods conflict when their archives both carry the same ``def/...``
path: whichever sits higher in the load order wins, the other's version is
shadowed. This is a HINT, never an error - for maps an overlap is often
intentional and the load order resolves it. We only look at ``def/`` paths
(manifest/icon overlap is normal and ignored - those are not in def_files); the
scanner has already normalised the 1.48 ``base/`` package layer, so a
``base/def/...`` mod is compared as ``def/...`` here.

Pure set logic over the already-cached def file lists; no archive I/O here.
The detection uses an inverted index (def path -> owners) so it scales with
the number of shared files, not the square of the mod count.
